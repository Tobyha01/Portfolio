    <h4>Name:</h4>
     <P>Toby Hamilton</P>

    <h4>Personal Statement:</h4>
        <p>
          As a recent graduate from Generation's UK & Ireland software engineering bootcamp, 
          I'm proficient in: html, css, javascript and typescript. I'm a keen problem solver 
          and strong communicator, a skillset which I've developed whilst both working in the
          automotive and customer service sectors. I also pay attention to detail, ensuring 
          minimal mistakes are made as small unnoticed errors could lead to bigger problems 
          over time. I'm currently seeking a position as a software engineering apprentice 
          because, the idea of creating programmes and seeing the impact of my work really 
          appeals to me.
        </p>

    <h4>My Experince So Far:</h4>
        <p> 
          So far I've gained 6 months experience learning python online, learning how to
          use for loops, while loops and if statements within functions to manipulate data
          of various kinds including: numbers, arrays and key-value pairs within dictionaires.
          I've also spent 6 weeks on a highly competitve software engineering boot-camp learning 
          the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and TypeScript. In this time I've gained experience
          in semantic and respionsive HTML webpage design, using various CSS styling prtoperties, 
          to manipulate HTML elements. I've gained experience on how to use JavaScript to create
          functions and manipulate HTML elements, including using JavaScript to store information
          entered into a user input form on a webpage.
