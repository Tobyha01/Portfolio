    <h4>Name:</h4>
     <P>Toby Hamilton</P>

    <h4>Personal Statement:</h4>
        <p>
         Graduate from Generation's UK & Ireland Software Engineering Bootcamp run in conjunction with 
         Multiverse. Proficient in: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and TypeScript. I,m a keen problem solver and
         strong communicator, a skillset which I've developed whilst both working in the automotive and 
         customer service sectors. Working at pace is something I am comfortable with and enjoy, due to 
         my time working at the fast pace food start up Gorillas. I'm currently working as a level 4 
         software developer Apprentice because, the idea of creating programmes and seeing the impact of 
         my work thoroughly excites me, and as a software developer this is a common occurence, whether it's
         fixing bugs that prveent fucntionality to the end user, or improving end user functionality by developing
         new applications.
        </p>

    <h4>My Experince So Far:</h4>
        <p> 
          So far I've gained 6 months experience learning python online, learning how to use for loops, 
          while loops and if statements within functions to manipulate data of various kinds including: 
          numbers, arrays and key-value pairs within object and dictionaries. I've also spent 6 weeks on
          a highly competitve software engineering boot-camp learning the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript
          nd TypeScript. In this time I've gained experience in semantic and respionsive HTML webpage design,
          using various CSS styling properties, to manipulate HTML elements using the DOM method. I've gained
          experience on how to use JavaScript to create functions and manipulate HTML elements with the DOM method,
          including using JavaScript to store information entered into a user input form on a webpage, save it
          as a tile on the webpage and also delete a speciifed tile using buttons. In December I Started a level
          4 sofware development apprenticeship, which includes a mandatory 12 week bootcamp at the start of the
          apprenticeship, where so far I've been learning the fundamentals of Javascript HTML, CSS and best practises
          for source control, later on in the bootcamp I will be taught on topics such as: SQL and Reactjs.
