    <h4>Personal Statement:</h4>
        <p>An inquisitive and naturally curious person, I'm a motivated candidate who's 
            focused on providing effective and efficient solutions to a high level of standard. 
            I thrive working in a team environment, or in an individual setting. In any setting 
            I find ways to develop my own personal and technical skills further, with a thirst 
            for learning about new systems and how they operate. As I develop my career, I'm 
            seeking out new opportunities in the Tech Industry.</p>

    <h4>My Experince So Far:</h4>
        <p>So far i have spent the last 6 months learning my python online in my spare time,
            learning how to use for loops, while loops and if statements within functions to 
            manipulate data of various kinds including: numbers, arrays and key-value pairs
            within dictionaires. I have also spent the last 6 weeks on training bootcamp 
            learning the basics of html, css and javascript. Within the past 6 weeks I've
            learnt about semantic html, various styling attributes within css, and also how
            to create functions within java script, to perform many tasks inlcuding:
            incorporating a functioning save button for a form which when pressed will save
            the data to the webpage.</p>
