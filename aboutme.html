    <h4>Name:</h4>
     <P>Toby Hamilton</P>

    <h4>Personal Statement:</h4>
        <p>
         Graduate from Generation's UK & Ireland Software Engineering Bootcamp run in conjunction with 
         Multiverse. Proficient in: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and TypeScript. I,m a keen problem solver and
         strong communicator, a skillset which I've developed whilst both working in the automotive and 
         customer service sectors. Working at pace is something I am comfortable with and enjoy, due to 
         my time working at the fast pace food start up Gorillas. I'm currently working as a level 4 
         software developer Apprentice because, the idea of creating programmes and seeing the impact of 
         my work thoroughly excites me, and as a software developer this is a common occurence, whether it's
         fixing bugs that prveent fucntionality to the end user, or improving end user functionality by developing
         new applications.
        </p>

    <h4>My Experince So Far:</h4>
        <p> 
          So far I've gained 6 months experience learning python online, learning how to use for loops, 
          while loops and if statements within functions to manipulate data of various kinds including: 
          numbers, arrays and key-value pairs within object and dictionaries. I've also spent 6 weeks on
          a highly competitve software engineering boot-camp learning the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript
          nd TypeScript. In this time I've gained experience in semantic and respionsive HTML webpage design,
          using various CSS styling properties, to manipulate HTML elements using the DOM method. I've gained
          experience on how to use JavaScript to create functions and manipulate HTML elements with the DOM method,
          including using JavaScript to store information entered into a user input form on a webpage, save it
          as a tile on the webpage and also delete a speciifed tile using buttons. In December I Started a level
          4 sofware development apprenticeship, which includes a mandatory 12 week bootcamp at the start of the
          apprenticeship, where so far I've been learning the fundamentals of Javascript HTML, CSS and best practises
          for source control, later on in the bootcamp I will be taught on topics such as: SQL and Reactjs.  
        </p>

    <h4>An Insight To Who I Am</h4>
      <p>
        Once again I'd like to take a moment to thankyou for visiting my website and hope your experince has been
        pleaseant thus far. Hi my name's Toby, I'm 24 years of age, born and raised in London. Since leaveing schhol
        at the age of 16, I've spent 3yrs completing a vehicle technician apprenticeship and have 2 years of qualified
        industry experince in the field. I also briefly worked in a start-up online grocery delivery company within the
        rider operations department. Now currently on a level 4 software devloper apprentice, I'm looking to starting a
        career in the tech industry. 
      </p>

      <p>  
        During my free time I enjoy doing various activities outisde, I've been on several
        hiking and wild camping trips with friends, ranging from 1 - a couple days trip up to a 10 trip, I've been to various
        places across the UK including but not limited to: Snowdonia, The Lake District and Scotland. Apart from hiking
        I also enjoy rock climbing both outside and at indoor centres, much like software development climbing is also a 
        displine where success doesn't often come easy when your at the limit of your capabilities. I also enjoy participating
        in many other sports including but not limited to: cycling, kayaking, running, skiing, camping/wild camping. Apart
        from staying active I also enjoy classic motoring and have one or two projects of my own that I try to tinker with
        when time and money allows me too. 
      </p>  
        
      <p>
        Additionally I've recently devloped an interest in spectating Formula 1, and enjoy
        watching how the fast paced action unfolds over a race weekend, and how teams and drivers cope with the pressures.
      </p>  

      <p>  
        Apart from using my time to participate in various activities I also like discussing topics, heavy or not and being
        able to discuss them not from an emotional level, but from a birds I view of the topic pulling apart flaws in both 
        my and other peoples arguments, allowing the debate to flow back and foruth and see where it takes us, as I could 
        learn from a new perspective, or discover a new piece of information I hadn't before, and I love learning new information.
        I don't necessarily always retain it unfortunately, but I love asking questions and finding out the "why's" and 
        the "how's" in life, almost like a 5 year old in that regard. 
      </p>

      <p> 
        I love to help my friends where I can, whether they need financial support, require help with a task or emotinal/ life advice, 
        I will try and fit it around my very avaible schedule, and try and support them to the best of my ability. I try to be open when
        meeting new people and not judging them based on there appearance or what there wearing. 
      </p>

      <p>
        When it comes to learning new concepts I find I learn best not only from watching demonstartions but also having time
        to practise it myself and ask a real person questions if I get stuck along the way, so I can almost visualise what's 
        going on, sometimes I find that forumns can be difficult for interpreting explanations, as there could be a misunderstanding
        about what someone is trying to say, however in the past when I attempted to learn python using an online resource, when I got
        stuck, I was pleasently surprised how patient some of the other forumn users, providing solutions to my query were. As sometimes
        I really did need it explained to me like I'm 5, which in my experience really is an art form.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        One of my biggest flaws is sometimes I can get too focussed on one issue, if I fill something isn't right I won't be able to
        move on until I either come up with a solution, or if it's an aesthetic problem I will fixate on getting what to me would be the 
        perfect look.   
      </p>
